              Guys, it‚Äôs time to take control of our own health.
            </p>
            This is something we have all echoed time and time again. We know
            that the population is living longer, but that does not equate to
            living better. People of African-Caribbean or South Asian descent
            are two to four times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Over
            65% of White British adults are overweight or obese.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We know that many socioeconomic factors play a major role in our
            health outcome, however, one factor we can take control of today is
            the way in which we eat.

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Fibre is an essential part of a healthy diet, yet many people don‚Äôt
            get enough of it. It plays a crucial role in digestion, heart
            health, and overall well-being, making it an important nutrient to
            focus on.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            There are two main types of fibre, each with its own health
            benefits:
          </p>
          <p className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Soluble Fibre which Lower cholesterol levels, Regulate blood sugar
            levels and Promote heart health. These can be found in foods such as
            Oats, beans, lentils, apples, citrus fruits, carrots
          </p>
          <p className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Insoluble Fibre which Promotes regular digestion and prevent
            constipation and Support a healthy gut microbiome. They can be found
            in foods such as Whole grains, nuts, seeds, chickpeas, lentils and
            leafy greens
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Currently it is estimated that only 9% of adults meet the daily
            recommended fibre amount of 30g. Getting enough fibre in your diet
            is a simple yet powerful way to improve your health.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Which is why we are launching our Fibre Friday campaign. Each and
            every Friday we will provide a 15% discount on selected fibre
            products
